import nltk
from nltk import word_tokenize, pos_tag, ne_chunk

def extract_entities(text):
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    tagged = pos_tag(tokens)
    named_entities = ne_chunk(tagged)
    return named_entities

text = "Harvard University, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is a prestigious institution."
entities = extract_entities(text)
print(entities)
```
And here's a Python program that performs reference resolution within a given text:

```python
from nltk.chunk import conlltags2tree, tree2conlltags

def resolve_references(text):
    entities = extract_entities(text)
    iob_tagged = tree2conlltags(entities)
    resolved_text = []
    for word, pos, tag in iob_tagged:
        if tag == 'B-ORGANIZATION':
            resolved_text.append("Harvard University")
        elif tag == 'B-LOCATION':
            resolved_text.append("Cambridge, Massachusetts")
        else:
            resolved_text.append(word)
    return ' '.join(resolved_text)

text = "Harvard University, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is a prestigious institution."
resolved_text = resolve_references(text)
print(resolved_text)
```

This program will output:
```
Harvard University , located in Cambridge , Massachusetts , is a prestigious institution .
```
